## 🧭 What Is MetaManager.ai?

**MetaManager** is not a chatbot.  
It’s a system of autonomous agents that think, act, and manage work — just like a real manager would (minus the meetings).

### 📌 Core Features:
- 🗂️ **Task Delegation** — agents assign tasks based on strengths
- 📊 **Performance Feedback** — adaptive, context-aware reporting
- 💬 **Morale Tracking** — simulates team health & engagement
- 🧠 **Agent Memory** — decisions evolve from past performance

## ⚙️ How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Idea-->PlanningAgent;
    PlanningAgent-->DelegationAgent;
    DelegationAgent-->WorkerAgents;
    WorkerAgents-->FeedbackAgent;
    FeedbackAgent-->PlanningAgent;
````

> This loop lets agents **plan → delegate → execute → review** — just like a smart, self-improving manager.
